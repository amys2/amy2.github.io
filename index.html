<h1>Discussion about my favourite topic from DGA1020</h1>
<h2>A Web Development Assignment by Amy Spiteri</h2>
<br>
<p>Hello viewer! Today I shall be discussing about my favourite <br> 
    topic from DGA1020 which is 3D Art and Animation.
</p>
<br>
<h3>What did I learn from this topic?</h3>
<p>I learnt the fundamentals of the application called <strong>'Blender'</strong>.
   This helped me understand the basics on how to create 3D Art.
   <br> I learnt how to sculpt and create objects, how lighting works, rendering and <br>
   animating certain motion of the objects.

</p>
<br>
<p>So, why did I enjoy this topic?</p>
<ul>
    <li>I always admired 3D art and wanted to learn more about it.</li>
    <li>I enjoyed creating the assignment (making a fruit bowl with a spinning animation).</li>
</ul>
